The purpose of creating adjusting the Spearman Rank Correlation by a particular lag is to quantify correlation if it occurs at lag > 0. "

Since the only non-constant in the equation is $\\sum{iT_i}$, it would be sufficient to reject $H_0$ for large values of $\\sum{iT_i}$. To generate a p-value for this test, the original $\\sum{iT_i}$ can be compared to all permutations of $T_i$ (since under the null hypothesis it would be equally likely to see any rank $T_i$ to be paired with any $i$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting this test for different lags would simply mean shifting the two lists of ranks by some lag $k$ and running the above method with $N-k$ observations. However, since N changes with the lag, it is easiest to simply compute $r_s$, the Spearman rank correlation, as the test statistic. "
